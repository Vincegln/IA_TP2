This repository is a bout the second assignment we had to complete in our "Artificial Intelligence for Video Games" course.

### Calculation methods

The provided calculation methods are not all functionnal.

**Weighted Sum** works fine for all parts of the project.

**Prioritized** doesn't work above a *maximum speed* of 40. Beyond that value, the leader moves too much for the followers to be able to cope with all its movement variations.

**Dithered** doesn't have the *OnPursuitOffset* function implemented, which is the basic function used in the early questions of this assignment.
